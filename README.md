# Simple Library Management Web Application

This is a web application running on Glassfish server to demonstrate a simple library management system. My group assignment for Java Web course with three people.

The application hardly uses JavaScript, mainly build with JSP & Servlets, JSTL, Expression Language, Filter and pure HTML & CSS.

The functions for the application are defined by the roles:
* Admin: see the system log, disable an user's active session;
* Student: view available books, search or reserve book, view his profile and the books he leased;
* Staff: view available books, search book, renew books for students, remove & add books.

Other functions: filter user authentication and authorization, stop user from accessing forbidden resources.

This is the ERD and some demonstrating images.
